# Write-Up
This assignment is well written but could be improved in a few ways.
One thing that could be improved is the descriptions of each function in the interface.
Another thing that could be an improvement would be providing students with the exact input that will be used for testing their program.
I hope this feedback can provide the assignment writers with insight into how to make this assignment an official.
